# Product Guidelines: FIT-O-CHARITY Dashboard\n\n## 1. Visual Identity & Aesthetic\n- **Core Aesthetic:** Industrial Utilitarian / Cyberpunk. The UI should feel like a high-performance terminal or tactical mission control.\n- **Color Palette:**\n  - **Background:** Deep Charcoal (#050505) and Matte Black.\n  - **Primary Action:** Safety Orange (#FF6B35) for high visibility and "industrial" feel.\n  - **Success/Data:** Signal Green (#2ECC71) for active connections and positive metrics.\n  - **Borders/Grids:** Low-opacity whites and grays to create "tactile" panels.\n- **Typography:**\n  - **Headers:** Space Grotesk (Bold/Black) for a modern, aggressive feel.\n  - **Technical Data:** JetBrains Mono for a precise, monospaced look.\n\n## 2. Interface Standards\n- **Layout Strategy:** Asymmetric panels, diagonal textures, and "tech-specs" overlays. Avoid perfectly centered, generic templates.\n- **Glassmorphism:** Use frosted glass effects (`backdrop-filter: blur`) sparingly for top-level cards to add depth without losing the "grit."\n- **Feedback Systems:** \n  - Every successful action (like activity submission) must trigger a visual reward (Confetti).\n  - Use pulsing animations for live data feeds to indicate "system health."\n\n## 3. Communication Style\n- **Tone:** Professional, direct, and tactical. Use "Technical" terminology where appropriate (e.g., "INITIALIZING_SYNC", "PROTOCOL_ACHIEVEMENT", "UPLINK_STABLE").\n- **Language:** English (Technical).\n\n## 4. User Experience (UX) Goals\n- **Immediacy:** The landing page must reflect "Live" status immediately via WebSockets.\n- **Frictionless Entry:** Participant identification must be fast (unique 6-character code) with no password requirement.\n- **Motivation:** Visual progression (Charity Meter) must be prominent to show the "Why" behind the "What."
